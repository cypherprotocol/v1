# 🔐 cypher • [![ci](https://github.com/bmwoolf/cypher-contracts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bmwoolf/cypher-contracts/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/bmwoolf/cypher-contracts?label=license) ![solidity](https://img.shields.io/badge/solidity-^0.8.15-lightgrey)

Introducing Cypher, an on-chain security system to help prevent hacks. Integrate with all of your other preferred protocols and monitoring services.

[Website](https://limiter-mu.vercel.app/)

Deploy your contracts through our frontend with your custom parameters, extend our EscrowContract, and add these lines to your withdraw function:

```solidity
import {CypherProtocol} from "../../src/CypherProtocol.sol";

contract MockProtocol is CypherProtocol {
    constructor(address architect, address registry) CypherProtocol("MockProtocol", architect, registry) {}
}
```

```solidity
ICypherEscrow escrow = ICypherEscrow(getEscrow());
escrow.escrowETH{ value: ethBalances[msg.sender] }(msg.sender, msg.sender, 1);
```

From there, select how you want to be communicated with:

- Twitter
- Discord
- Telegram
- Cell
- Email

## Deploying contracts for tests

1. fill out your own `.env` with these vars:

```
# RPC URL sourced by scripts
RPC_URL=[enter_here]

# The deployment private key sourced by scripts
DEPLOYER_KEY=[enter_here]

# Etherscan key for contract verification
ETHERSCAN_KEY=[enter_here]
```

2. Enter this command to trigger Foundry's shell scripts: `bash utils/run_script.sh`
3. Then, when it asks you for the command, enter one of these depending on what you want to test:
   `Deploy`
   `DeployProd`
   `Mint`
4. Check the chain!

## Development

**Setup**

```bash
forge install
```

**Building**

```bash
forge build
```

**Testing**

```bash
forge test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`utils/`](./utils/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

_NOTE: These scripts are required to be \_executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./utils/*`.\_

_NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs)._

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:

```bash
foundryup
```

🎉 Foundry is installed! 🎉

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), all tests are written in Solidity! 🥳

Create a test file for your contract in the `test/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./test/Greeter.t.sol`](./test/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
